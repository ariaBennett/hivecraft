  Water:
    WaterChoose: As a waterbender, you no longer take any fall damage when landing on ice, snow or even 1-block-deep water. Additionally, sneaking in the water with a bending ability selected that does not utilize sneak (or no ability at all) will give you accelerated swimming. Lastly, you can pull water from plants with your abilities.
    HealingWaters: To use, the bender must be at least partially submerged in water. If the user is not sneaking, this ability will automatically begin working provided the user has it selected. If the user is sneaking, he/she is channeling the healing to their target in front of them. In order for this channel to be successful, the user and the target must be at least partially submerged in water.
    IceSpike: This ability has many functions. Clicking while targetting ice, or an entity over some ice, will raise a spike of ice up, damaging and slowing the target. Tapping sneak (shift) while selecting a water source will select that source that can then be fired with a click. Firing this will launch a spike of ice at your target, dealing a bit of damage and slowing the target. If you sneak (shift) while not selecting a source, many ice spikes will erupt from around you, damaging and slowing those targets.
    Surge: This ability has two distinct features. If you sneak to select a source block, you can then click in a direction and a large wave will be launched in that direction. If you sneak again while the wave is en route, the wave will freeze the next target it hits. If, instead, you click to select a source block, you can hold sneak to form a wall of water at your cursor location. Click to shift between a water wall and an ice wall. Release sneak to dissipate it.
    WaterBubble: To use, the bender must merely have the ability selected. All water around the user in a small bubble will vanish, replacing itself once the user either gets too far away or selects a different ability.
    Bloodbending: This ability was made illegal for a reason. With this ability selected, sneak while targetting something and you will bloodbend that target. Bloodbent targets cannot move, bend or attack. You are free to control their actions by looking elsewhere - they will be forced to move in that direction. Additionally, clicking while bloodbending will launch that target off in the direction you're looking. People who are capable of bloodbending are immune to your technique, and you are immune to theirs.
    Torrent: Torrent is one of the strongest moves in a waterbender's arsenal. To use, first click a source block to select it; then hold shift to begin streaming the water around you. Water flowing around you this way will damage and knock back nearby enemies and projectiles. If you release shift during this, you will create a large wave that expands outwards from you, launching anything in its path back. Instead, if you click you release the water and channel it to flow towards your cursor. Anything caught in the blast will be tossed about violently and take damage. Finally, if you click again when the water is torrenting, it will freeze the area around it when it is obstructed.
    WaterSpout: To use this ability, click while over or in water. You will spout water up from beneath you to experience controlled levitation. This ability is a toggle, so you can activate it then use other abilities and it will remain on. If you try to spout over an area with no water, snow or ice, the spout will dissipate and you will fall. Click again with this ability selected to deactivate it.
    WaterManipulation: 'To use, place your cursor over a waterbendable object and
      tap sneak (default: shift). Smoke will appear where you''ve selected, indicating
      the origin of your ability. After you have selected an origin, simply left-click
      in any direction and you will see your water spout off in that direction, slicing
      any creature in its path. If you look towards a creature when you use this ability,
      it will target that creature. A collision from Water Manipulation both knocks
      the target back and deals some damage. Alternatively, if you have source selected
      and tap shift again, you will be able to control the water more directly.'
    OctopusForm: This ability allows the waterbender to manipulate a large quantity of water into a form resembling that of an octopus. To use, click to select a water source. Then, hold sneak to channel this ability. While channeling, the water will form itself around you and has a chance to block incoming attacks. Additionally, you can click while channeling to attack things near you, dealing damage and knocking them back. Releasing shift at any time will dissipate the form.
    PhaseChange: 'To use, simply left-click. Any water you are looking at within range
      will instantly freeze over into solid ice. Provided you stay within range of
      the ice and do not unbind FreezeMelt, that ice will not thaw. If, however, you
      do either of those the ice will instantly thaw. If you sneak (default: shift),
      anything around where you are looking at will instantly melt. Since this is
      a more favorable state for these things, they will never re-freeze unless they
      would otherwise by nature or some other bending ability. Additionally, if you
      tap sneak while targetting water with FreezeMelt, it will evaporate water around
      that block that is above sea level. '
  Fire:
    FireBlast: FireBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of a firebender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A blast of fire will be created at your fingertips. If this blast contacts an enemy, it will dissipate and engulf them in flames, doing additional damage and knocking them back slightly. If the blast hits terrain, it will ignite the nearby area. Additionally, if you hold sneak, you will charge up the fireblast. If you release it when it's charged, it will instead launch a powerful fireball that explodes on contact.
    FireShield: FireShield is a basic defensive ability. Clicking with this ability selected will create a small disc of fire in front of you, which will block most attacks and bending. Alternatively, pressing and holding sneak creates a very small shield of fire, blocking most attacks. Creatures that contact this fire are ignited.
    Lightning: Hold sneak while selecting this ability to charge up a lightning strike. Once charged, release sneak to discharge the lightning to the targetted location.
    HeatControl: While this ability is selected, the firebender becomes impervious to fire damage and cannot be ignited. If the user left-clicks with this ability, the targeted area will be extinguished, although it will leave any creature burning engulfed in flames. This ability can also cool lava. If this ability is used while targetting ice or snow, it will instead melt blocks in that area. Finally, sneaking with this ability will cook any food in your hand.
    FireJet: This ability is used for a limited burst of flight for firebenders. Clicking with this ability selected will launch you in the direction you're looking, granting you controlled flight for a short time. This ability can be used mid-air to prevent falling to your death, but on the ground it can only be used if standing on a block that's ignitable (e.g. not snow or water).
    FireChoose: As a firebender, you now more quickly smother yourself when you catch on fire.
    Illumination: This ability gives firebenders a means of illuminating the area. It is a toggle - clicking will create a torch that follows you around. The torch will only appear on objects that are ignitable and can hold a torch (e.g. not leaves or ice). If you get too far away from the torch, it will disappear, but will reappear when you get on another ignitable block. Clicking again dismisses this torch.
    Blaze: To use, simply left-click in any direction. An arc of fire will flow from your location, igniting anything in its path. Additionally, tap sneak to engulf the area around you in roaring flames.
    FireBurst: 'FireBurst is a very powerful firebending ability. To use, press and
      hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak
      to launch a cone-shaped burst of flames in front of you, or click to release
      the burst in a sphere around you. '
    WallOfFire: To use this ability, click at a location. A wall of fire will appear at this location, igniting enemies caught in it and blocking projectiles.
  Air:
    AirChoose: As an airbender, you now take no falling damage, have faster sprinting and higher jumps. Additionally, daily activities are easier for you - your food meter decays at a much slower rate
    AirSwipe: To use, simply left-click in a direction. An arc of air will flow from you towards that direction, cutting and pushing back anything in its path. Its damage is minimal, but it still sends the message. This ability will extinguish fires, cool lava, and cut things like grass, mushrooms and flowers. Additionally, you can charge it by holding sneak. Charging before attacking will increase damage and knockback, up to a maximum.
    AirBurst: AirBurst is one of the most powerful abilities in the airbender's arsenal. To use, press and hold sneak to charge your burst. Once charged, you can either release sneak to launch a cone-shaped burst of air in front of you, or click to release the burst in a sphere around you. Additionally, having this ability selected when you land on the ground from a large enough fall will create a burst of air around you.
    AirScooter: AirScooter is a fast means of transportation. To use, sprint, jump then click with this ability selected. You will hop on a scooter of air and be propelled forward in the direction you're looking (you don't need to press anything). This ability can be used to levitate above liquids, but it cannot go up steep slopes. Any other actions will deactivate this ability.
    AirBubble: To use, the bender must merely have the ability selected. All water around the user in a small bubble will vanish, replacing itself once the user either gets too far away or selects a different ability.
    Tornado: 'To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a swirling vortex
      at the targeted location. Any creature or object caught in the vortex will be
      launched up and out in some random direction. If another player gets caught
      in the vortex, the launching effect is minimal. Tornado can also be used to
      transport the user. If the user gets caught in his/her own tornado, his movements
      are much more manageable. Provided the user doesn''t fall out of the vortex,
      it will take him to a maximum height and move him in the general direction he''s
      looking. Skilled airbenders can scale anything with this ability.'
    AirSuction: To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will originate as far as it can in that direction and flow towards you, sucking anything in its path harmlessly with it. Skilled benders can use this technique to pull items from precarious locations. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirSuction to your targeted location.
    AirShield: 'Air Shield is one of the most powerful defensive techniques in existence.
      To use, simply sneak (default: shift). This will create a whirlwind of air around
      the user, with a small pocket of safe space in the center. This wind will deflect
      all projectiles and will prevent any creature from entering it for as long as
      its maintained. '
    AirBlast: AirBlast is the most fundamental bending technique of an airbender. To use, simply left-click in a direction. A gust of wind will be created at your fingertips, launching anything in its path harmlessly back. A gust of air can extinguish fires on the ground or on a player, can cool lava, and can flip levers and activate buttons. Additionally, tapping sneak will change the origin of your next AirBlast to your targeted location.
    AirSpout: This ability gives the airbender limited sustained levitation. It is a toggle - click to activate and form a whirling spout of air beneath you, lifting you up. You can bend other abilities while using AirSpout. Click again to deactivate this ability.
  Chiblocker:
    Paralyze: Paralyzes the target, making them unable to do anything for a short period of time. This ability has a long cooldown.
    HighJump: To use this ability, simply click. You will jump quite high. This ability has a short cooldown.
    RapidPunch: This ability allows the chiblocker to punch rapidly in a short period. To use, simply punch. This has a short cooldown.
    ChiChoose: As a chiblocker, you have no active abilities to bind. Instead, you have improved sprinting and jumping, have a dodge chance and deal more damage with your fists. Additionally, punching a bender will block his/her chi for a few seconds, preventing him/her from bending (and even stopping their passive!).
  Earth:
    EarthGrab: To use, simply left-click while targeting a creature within range. This ability will erect a circle of earth to trap the creature in.
    EarthChoose: As an earthbender, upon landing on bendable earth, you will briefly turn the area to soft sand, negating any fall damage you would have otherwise taken.
    Tremorsense: This is a pure utility ability for earthbenders. If you have this ability bound to any slot whatsoever, then you are able to 'see' using the earth. If you are in an area of low-light and are standing on top of an earthbendable block, this ability will automatically turn that block into glowstone, visible *only by you*. If you lose contact with a bendable block, the light will go out, as you have lost contact with the earth and cannot 'see' until you can touch earth again. Additionally, if you click with this ability selected, smoke will appear above nearby earth with pockets of air beneath them.
    EarthArmor: This ability encases the earthbender in temporary armor. To use, click on a block that is earthbendable. If there is another block under it that is earthbendable, the block will fly to you and grant you temporary armor and damage reduction. This ability has a long cooldown.
    RaiseEarth: 'To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. A column of
      earth will shoot upwards from that location. Anything in the way of the column
      will be brought up with it, leaving talented benders the ability to trap brainless
      entities up there. Additionally, simply sneak (default shift) looking at an
      earthbendable block. A wall of earth will shoot upwards from that location.
      Anything in the way of the wall will be brought up with it. '
    Shockwave: 'This is one of the most powerful moves in the earthbender''s arsenal.
      To use, you must first charge it by holding sneak (default: shift). Once charged,
      you can release sneak to create an enormous shockwave of earth, disturbing all
      earth around you and expanding radially outwards. Anything caught in the shockwave
      will be blasted back and dealt damage. If you instead click while charged, the
      disruption is focused in a cone in front of you. Lastly, if you fall from a
      great enough height with this ability selected, you will automatically create
      a shockwave.'
    EarthBlast: 'To use, place your cursor over an earthbendable object (dirt, rock,
      ores, etc) and tap sneak (default: shift). The object will temporarily turn
      to stone, indicating that you have it focused as the source for your ability.
      After you have selected an origin (you no longer need to be sneaking), simply
      left-click in any direction and you will see your object launch off in that
      direction, smashing into any creature in its path. If you look towards a creature
      when you use this ability, it will target that creature. A collision from Earth
      Blast both knocks the target back and deals some damage. You cannot have multiple
      of these abilities flying at the same time.'
    Collapse: ' To use, simply left-click on an earthbendable block. That block and
      the earthbendable blocks above it will be shoved back into the earth below them,
      if they can. This ability does have the capacity to trap something inside of
      it, although it is incredibly difficult to do so. Additionally, press sneak
      with this ability to affect an area around your targetted location - all earth
      that can be moved downwards will be moved downwards. This ability is especially
      risky or deadly in caves, depending on the earthbender''s goal and technique.'
    Catapult: To use, left-click while looking in the direction you want to be launched. A pillar of earth will jut up from under you and launch you in that direction - if and only if there is enough earth behind where you're looking to launch you. Skillful use of this ability takes much time and work, and it does result in the death of certain gung-ho earthbenders. If you plan to use this ability, be sure you've read about your passive ability you innately have as an earthbender.
    EarthTunnel: 'Earth Tunnel is a completely utility ability for earthbenders. To
      use, simply sneak (default: shift) in the direction you want to tunnel. You
      will slowly begin tunneling in the direction you''re facing for as long as you
      sneak or if the tunnel has been dug long enough. This ability will be interupted
      if it hits a block that cannot be earthbent.'
  Other:
    AvatarState: The signature ability of the Avatar, this is a toggle. Click to activate to become nearly unstoppable. While in the Avatar State, the user takes severely reduced damage from all sources, regenerates health rapidly, and is granted extreme speed. Nearly all abilities are incredibly amplified in this state. Additionally, AirShield and FireJet become toggle-able abilities and last until you deactivate them or the Avatar State. Click again with the Avatar State selected to deactivate it.
